  abstract = {We present a novel experimental design to measure honesty and lying. Participants receive a die which they roll privately. Since their payoff depends on the reported roll of the die, the subjects have an incentive to be dishonest and report higher numbers to get a higher payoff. This design has three advantages. First, cheating cannot be detected on the individual level, which reduces potential demand effects. Second, the method is very easy to implement. Third, the underlying true distribution of the outcome under full honesty is known, and hence …},

Agents are born into player roles and play the signalling game against a random opponent each period. Inexperienced agents know their opponents’ payoff functions but not the prevailing distribution of opponents’ play. One refinement corresponds to an upper bound on the set of possible learning outcomes while the other provides a lower bound. Both refinements are closely related to divine equilibrium (Banks},

The paper presents a model of lying costs that generates hypotheses regarding behavior. In an experiment, we find that the highest fraction of lies is from reporting the maximal outcome, but some participants do not make the maximal lie. More participants lie partially when the experimenter cannot observe their outcomes than when the experimenter can verify the ...},

Using a classic coordination game, we ask all players to sign voluntarily a truth-telling oath before playing the game with cheap talk communication. Three results emerge with commitment under oath:(1) coordination increased by nearly 50\%;(2) senders' messages were significantly ...},
