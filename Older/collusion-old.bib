Since their payoff depends on the reported roll of the die, the subjects have an incentive to be dishonest and report higher numbers to get a higher payoff. This design has three advantages. First, cheating cannot be detected on the individual level, which reduces potential demand effects. Second, the method is very easy to implement. Third, the underlying true distribution of the outcome under full honesty is known, and hence …},

Agents are born into player roles and play the signalling game against a random opponent each period. Inexperienced agents know their opponents’ payoff functions but not the prevailing distribution of opponents’ play. One refinement corresponds to an upper bound on the set of possible learning outcomes while the other provides a lower bound. Both refinements are closely related to divine equilibrium (Banks},
